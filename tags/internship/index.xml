&lt;p>As I said on my &lt;a href="https://claubatista.github.io/post/01-31-2022-edit-and-resend/">previous blog post&lt;/a>, in this one I’ll present more details about my Outreachy project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To recap, I’m an Outreachy intern at Mozilla working on the Network monitor on the Devtools team. The main goal of my project is to write a new Edit and Resend panel on the Netmonitor based on the current one, with an update interface. The Edit and Resend panel is a tool for sending custom HTTP requests directly through the Netmonitor interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just finished implementing most of the features and updates that were planned, and now I’m going into a new phase of the project where I’ll focus more on testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-new">What is new?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="opening-the-panel">Opening the panel&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Just like the current panel, the new panel can be opened by right-clicking on any request on the Network panel and selecting the “Edit and Resend” option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://claubatista.github.io/images/02-08-2022-edit-and-resend.gif" alt="edit-and-resend.gif">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notice that the new panel is now on the left side, we made this change so that users could inspect a request on the right panel and still have the edit and resend panel open.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also a new way to open the panel through toolbar&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://claubatista.github.io/images/02-08-2022-toolbar.gif" alt="toolbar.gif">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the panel is open using this method, it is empty. This is useful for the case when a user wants to send a new request not based on any of the listed ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="using-the-panel">Using the panel&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the most different areas on the new panel is the headers section. The current panel provides only a textarea for editing headers, where each header is separated by a new line and the name and value are separated by a colon. On the new panel, each header has its own line and the name and value are in different input areas. When a user wants to add a new header, they can do so by using the fields on the last line of the header section and clicking enter. There are minor validations at this point to disallow headers with empty names and values.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://claubatista.github.io/images/02-08-2022-headers.gif" alt="headers.gif">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once a header is added, it can be deleted from the list simply by hovering on it and clicking on the “x” sign that shows up. The headers name and value can also be edited. Only headers which are added by the browser cannot be deleted or edited and show up as disabled on the list. Finally, there is also a checkbox next to each header to disable/enable it without deleting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://claubatista.github.io/images/02-08-2022-headers-disable.gif" alt="headers-disabel.gif">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The URL query parameters section looks very similar to the headers one, however it is not as feature intensive. In order to edit, delete or add query params changes need to be made directly on the URL field, these changes are then mirrored on the query parameters section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://claubatista.github.io/images/02-08-2022-query-params.gif" alt="params.gif">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only thing that can be done through the query parameter section directly is to check or uncheck a given query param.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://claubatista.github.io/images/02-08-2022-query-params-disable.gif" alt="params-disable.gif">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some other updates that are worth calling out are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>the clear button, which was added right next to the send button and is an easy way to clear the whole form;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the input areas for the URL and Headers auto grow in height as you type;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and whenever a new request is made successfully it is automatically selected and the panel on the right side of the Netmonitor is opened for the user to check out details on the new request.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="what-are-the-next-steps">What are the next steps?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I still have a little over a month before the internship period ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My goals from now on are to work on testing and improving the interface and its accessibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m very happy to work on this project and have the opportunity to contribute to the Firefox Devtools. None of the changes that I describe here would have been possible without all the help that I got from my mentors: bomsy and Honza.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope you have also liked the new changes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HTTP Edit &amp; Resend Panel</title><link>http://claubatista.github.io/post/01-31-2022-edit-and-resend/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://claubatista.github.io/post/01-31-2022-edit-and-resend/</guid><description>&lt;p>hello everyone 🤙🏼&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I will present my project to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Firefox DevTools have an Edit &amp;amp; Resend Panel and the goal of my project is to create a new one, based on the old one but with new user interface and functionalities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://claubatista.github.io/images/01-31-2022-old-panel.png" alt="Screenshot 2022-01-30 at 17.12.57.png">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-create-a-new-one">Why create a new one?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We didn’t create one from scratch, we created the new one based on the old one. We used the same structure of the old one, but tried to simplify the code. The old one used Redux, and now we avoided using Redux as much as possible as not to put too much complexity into the code, and to make it easier to maintain in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-it-edit--resend">What is it Edit &amp;amp; Resend?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Edit and Resend is a panel through which the developer can send a synthetic HTTP network request. It is useful for building, testing and using REST APIs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-is-the-project-going">How is the project going?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The project is going well. Now I’m finishing the interface changes. I have already done the first part of the project, which was to change the panel to the other side, to add all basic functionalities and put everything behind a pref.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Feb 8th will the release of Firefox 99. All my changes will be available there for testing behind a pref &lt;strong>“devtools.netmonitor.features.newEditAndResend”&lt;/strong> and on Firefox Nightly by default. Before then, I will write a new blog detailing all the changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll leave you with a small spoiler of the new panel before the UI changes:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>See you next week, thanks for reading. 🙂&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Patch stacks</title><link>http://claubatista.github.io/post/01-15-2022-patch-stack/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://claubatista.github.io/post/01-15-2022-patch-stack/</guid><description>&lt;p>hello folks 🤙🏼&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Outreachy suggested that we write about an open source vocabulary term, I was very confused and lost, not knowing what I would write 🙃. A “vocabulary term” could be a word, phrase, acronym, or concept that was new to us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After two Outreachy tries and some time contributing to Mozilla, I feel a lot more familiar with the terms and the tools. Obviously, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t always like this, Mozilla has a particular process, some projects use GitHub to file the issues, but Mozilla also has Bugzilla, which is a website to track bugs. There are also, Phabricator, and Searchfox (which is my best friend now).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I started my internship, I was familiar with these tools. However, in my time contributing, I worked on isolated bugs mostly from unrelated projects, so I could work in one bug, finish it and only then start a new one. On my first week I was a bit disoriented, because my bugs depended on each other and I had a deadline, so I couldn’t just wait for a bug to be merged to start the next. I asked my mentor the best practice here, and he told me I could work on top of my first bug, before it was landed 🤯.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was learning about &lt;strong>patch stacks.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGckDoXF37BtZMUE/giphy.gif" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGckDoXF37BtZMUE/giphy.gif">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patch stacks are a group of patches that depend on each other. This allows to break patches in small pieces, which are easier to review, and allow you to work faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patch stacks are analogous to GitHub pull requests with multiple commits. However, patch stacks go beyond pull requests. On Phabricator, each commit results in a separate patch, because each commit is a separate patch, they can also be reviewed, accepted and landed separately. This makes it easy for me to move on to new bugs before a previous blocking patch is landed by adding new patches to my stack. In GitHub, if I kept adding new commits to an existing pull request, that would just delay merging and make reviews harder. See, for example, the current patch stack I’m working on:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://claubatista.github.io/images/01-15-2022-patch-stack.png" alt="Sreenshort about my stack">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been using this &lt;a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/stack_quickref.html#rebasing-the-stack">source&lt;/a> to help me, and of course I ask questions. Sometimes I forget that it is ok to ask questions, because I don’t want my mentor to know that I don’t understand something, but a note to myself: &lt;strong>it is TOTALLY ok to not know.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks for reading, I hope you can enjoy the next ones too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Outreachy Indroduction</title><link>http://claubatista.github.io/post/12-12-2021-outreachy-introduction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://claubatista.github.io/post/12-12-2021-outreachy-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello everyone! 🤙🏼&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I never thought that I would have a blog, but here I am writing my first post 😅.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to introduce myself and explain why I started this new adventure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m Clau, I&amp;rsquo;m Brazilian, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Berlin, Germany since 2020.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My hobbies are cuddling my dogs 🐶, reading, exercising, spending time with my family and friends and playing the best sport in the world: &lt;a href="https://wftda.com/new-fans/">roller derby&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And since December 6th, 2021 I am an &lt;a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy&lt;/a> intern in the Firefox Devtools Project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-i-got-here">How I got here&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After 6 years working in HR, I decided to change careers and become a programmer. It was not an easy decision, but I was &lt;strong>determinated&lt;/strong> to start a new career where I felt more &lt;strong>challenged.&lt;/strong> In 2018, I started a frontend development bootcamp aimed at inserting women in the technology area. From then on, my life changed a lot: I learned that I love programming, I met my wife, I learned about Mozilla and Outreachy. &lt;em>All of these things&lt;/em> brought me here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two years later, I moved to Berlin with my wife and my two dogs. At first, I was focusing on learning English to try a job here, and I decided to prepare myself for the next Outreachy round in may/2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose to contribute to Mozilla Firefox, because it is my main browser, which I love, and I really admire &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s mission&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contribution period was a time that I felt a lot of fear. I was insecure about everything, even sending a message to the mentor, but it was also a period that I felt &lt;strong>courageous&lt;/strong>. Even with all my insecurities, I did a lot of contributions to a big project, with a huge code base. I got out of my comfort zone and did things that I thought I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do. That was an amazing period, where I learned a lot. Unfortunately, I was not selected, but I was more confident, and I love a &lt;strong>challenge&lt;/strong>, so I decided to continue contributing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="firefox-devtools">Firefox Devtools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my second try for Outreachy, I felt more prepared. The terminologies were not new anymore, but the fear of the possibility of not being chosen again was there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DevTools are one of the components that I use and like the most in Firefox, since I started thinking about contributing, that is the component I wanted to volunteer for, so when I saw the Devtools submitted a project, I was sure I would try it. Different from the other time, when I tried only one project, this time I tried two (Firefox DevTools HTTP Edit &amp;amp; Resend and Improve reliability of the Firefox Bookmark dialogs). I will confess, it was not a good idea. I wanted to try to increase my possibility of being picked, but it is hard to focus on two projects.
In the end, I knew I had dedicated myself more in one than in the other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In life, things happen when they have to happen. In this second try, I was picked for the project that I always wanted to volunteer, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more happy. 🎉&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am completely excited to work these 3 months together with my mentors Honza and Hubert and also to be able to contribute full time to Mozilla and make the internet better for all. 💚&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-core-values">My Core values&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The words in bold throughout this text are my core values. I believe, &lt;strong>challenges, determination and courage&lt;/strong> are what guides me in every area in my life. I like to feel challenged, this motivates me to learn new things. I have determination to try new things and not stop when it is hard. Courage is what drives me forward even when I am afraid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is only chapter 1 of this new adventure, I hope you can enjoy the next ones too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks for reading.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
